# predicting-jeopardy-values

This is my capstone project for the Galvanize Data Science Immersive. I am attempting to predict the value of Jeopardy questions based on the question, answer, and category. The model is then used to understand the kinds of knowledge represented in the Jeopardy corpus and what is valued more highly.
