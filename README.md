# Trivial Pursuit: *Jeopardy!* Questions and the Value of Knowledge

The goal of this project is to predict the dollar value of *Jeopardy!* Questions. This might seem like a trivial endeavor (pun *totally* intended). However, this analysis could tell us a lot about the kind of knowledge that we (or at least the writers of *Jeopardy!*) value in Western society, what is considered common knowledge, and what is considered more difficult.

In addition, this project could be extended to any test for which the questions are ordered or assigned points by difficulty, such as standardized tests, giving students a sense of where to prioritize study efforts.

## The Dataset

* approximately 217,000 *Jeopardy!* questions from 1984 to 2012
* includes the question, answer, value, category, round, show number, and air date
* by design, the target values are roughly balanced

### Data Cleaning

* *Jeopardy!* questions doubled in value in November 2001, so I doubled all values before that time
* I excluded Daily Double and Final Jeopardy questions, for which the value is determined by the contestant
